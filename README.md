# GCC_STUFF
Just of collection of code that I have written using the GCC compiler and code from some tutorials that have helped me learn how to use GCC. 
Currently I am using avr C, but look forward to exploring ARM processors in the future. 
I am currently working on writing bootloader for my arduino Uno.
